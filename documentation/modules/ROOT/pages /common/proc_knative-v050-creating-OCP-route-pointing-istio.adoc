= Creating an OpenShift Route pointing to the istio-ingressgateway for each of your Knative Services 

NOTE: The install script sets privileges for a specific namespace. Results are different when using a namespace other than "myproject". If the user wants to use the install script in another namespace, it needs to be called out.

.Procedure
. Create a route by using the `oc expose` command.

```
oc expose svc istio-ingressgateway --hostname=<servicename>.<projectname>.<openshiftdomain> --name=<servicename> -n istio-system
```

For example, if the following inputs are used:

- knative service name: _helloworld_
- project: _my project_
- cluster wildcard domain: _apps.demo1.d103.sandbox718.opentlc.com_
    
the `oc command` would be:

```
oc expose svc istio-ingressgateway --hostname=helloworld.myproject.apps.demo1.d103.sandbox718.opentlc.com --name=helloworld -n istio-system
```
