:description: Use {smproductname} to isolate network traffic with {serverlessproductname}

{smproductshortname} can be used to isolate network-traffic between tenants on a shared OpenShift cluster using {smproductshortname} `AuthorizationPolicy` resources.
{serverlessproductname} can also leverage this, using several {smproductshortname} resources.

.Tenants
A tenant is a group of one or multiple OpenShift projects that can access each other over the network on a shared OpenShift cluster.

.High-level architecture
The high-level architecture consists of `AuthorizationPolicies` in the `knative-serving`, `knative-eventing` and the tenants namespaces, while all components are part of the {smproductshortname}. The injected {smproductshortname} sidecars take care of enforcing those rules to isolate network traffic between tenants.

*Knative Serving*

. Workloads in project tenant-2 can not call workloads in project tenant-1 directly. Requests are rejected in the Istio proxies of tenant-1 workloads.
. Workloads in project tenant-2 can not call workloads in project tenant-1 via ingress-gateway. Requests are rejected in the Istio proxies of tenant-1 workloads.
. Workloads in project tenant-2 can not call workloads in project tenant-1 via activator. Requests are rejected in the Istio proxy of the activator component. Note: as ingress-gateway is allowed to call activator, this includes requests from project tenant-2 via ingress-gateway to activator.
. ðŸ”’ `AuthorizationPolicies` are applied in this project


*Knative Eventing*

image::service-mesh/multi-tenancy-service-mesh-Eventing.drawio.svg[]

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.

* You have set up {serverlessproductname} and {smproductname} as documented in xref:./common-service-mesh-setup.adoc[].

* You have created one or multiple OpenShift projects for each tenant.


.Securing the {smproductshortname}

. As in the set-up documentation, make sure that all your tenants OpenShift projects are part of the same `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` object as members:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
 name: default
 namespace: istio-system
spec:
 members:
   - knative-serving    # static value, needs to be here, see setup page
   - knative-eventing   # static value, needs to be here, see setup page
   - team-alpha-1       # example OpenShift project that belongs to the team-alpha tenant
   - team-alpha-2       # example OpenShift project that belongs th the team-alpha tenant
   - team-bravo-1       # example OpenShift project that belongs to the team-bravo tenant
   - team-bravo-2       # example OpenShift project that belongs th the team-bravo tenant
----
+
All the OpenShift projects that are part of the mesh must enforce mTLS in strict mode. This forces Istio to only accept connections with a client-certificate present and allows the {smproductshortname} sidecar to validate the origin using `AuthorizationPolicy`.
+
. For {serverlessproductname} internal components to work, the several `AuthorizationPolicies` are necessary in the `knative-serving` and the `knative-eventing` namespace:

These policies restrict the access rules for the network communication between OpenShift Serverless' system components. In detail, they enforce the following rules:
- Deny all traffic that is not explicitly allowed in `knative-serving` and `knative-eventing`
- Allow traffic from `istio-system` and `knative-serving` to activator
- Allow traffic from `knative-serving` to autoscaler
- Allow health probes for Apache Kafka components in `knative-eventing`
- Allow internal traffic for channel based brokers in `knative-eventing`
+
Make sure to apply all those rules to your cluster with:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. With this set up in place, cluster administrators can use their own `AuthorizationPolicies` to define which OpenShift projects can communicate with each other. Every OpenShift project of a tenant needs:
- One `AuthorizationPolicy` limiting directly incoming traffic to the tenants OpenShift project
- One `AuthorizationPolicy` limiting incoming traffic via the activator component of {serverlessproductname} that runs in the `knative-serving` OpenShift project
- One `AuthorizationPolicy` allowing Kubernetes to call `PreStopHooks` on Knative Services
+
As it is a cumbersome task to create all those policies by hand, you can use our link:https://github.com/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-chart[helm based generator] to create the necessary resources for each tenant:
+
[source,terminal]
.Create resources per tenant with helm
----
helm template oci://quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-onboarding --version 1.31.0 --set "name=team-alpha" --set "namespaces={team-alpha-1,team-alpha-2}" > team-alpha.yaml
helm template oci://quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-onboarding --version 1.31.0 --set "name=team-bravo" --set "namespaces={team-bravo-1,team-bravo-2}" > team-bravo.yaml
----
+
And apply the generated resources to your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The helm chart has several options that can be passed to configure the generated resources. Please refer to the link:https://github.com/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-chart/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml] for a full reference.
====


.Verifying the configuration

This verification is assuming that we have two tenants with one namespace each, all part of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, configured with resources listed above.
We can then use curl to verify the connectivity:

. Deploy Knative Services in both tenants namespaces:
