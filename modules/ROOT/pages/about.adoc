= About OpenShift Serverless Logic

_OpenShift Serverless Logic_ enables developers or architects to define declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications. Serverless Logic implements the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification, allowing developers and architects to define logical steps of execution declaratively (no code) for cloud-native services. The specification is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and is currently a CNCF Sandbox project.

OpenShift Serverless Logic is also designed to write workflows in formats (JSON or YAML) that might be better suited for developing and deploying serverless applications in cloud or container environments.

For Serverless Logic implementation, Kubernetes Operator can be used to deploy the workflow models using Knative. Knative Eventing plays an important role and provides the essential infrastructure for event-driven architectures.
