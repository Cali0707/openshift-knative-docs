= Knative on OpenShift Serverless

Knative allows for greater consistency and more granular scalability across applications and teams.

The benefits of Knative on OpenShift include:

* Use Kubernetes and OpenShift to build, scale, and manage serverless applications in any cloud, on-premise, or in a hybrid environment.

* Build modern, serverless functions, and support legacy apps through event sources. You can manage them alongside your other applications on Red Hat OpenShift.

* Knative allows app teams to focus on building products. Knative installs on OpenShift using operators, simplifying installation and automating updates and management.
