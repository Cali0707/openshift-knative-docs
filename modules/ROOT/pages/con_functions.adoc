= OpenShift Serverless Functions

OpenShift Serverless Functions enables developers to create and deploy stateless, event-driven functions as a Knative service on OpenShift Container Platform.

The `faas` CLI uses the CNCF Buildpack API to create a container image.
Once a container image has been created, the CLI can deploy it as a Knative service on the cluster configured in ``~/.kube/config`.

Serverless Functions supports the Go, Node.js and Quarkus runtimes.

OpenShift Serverless Functions currently supports the use of HTTP triggered functions, as well as functions triggered through Knative CloudEvents.
