= OpenShift Serverless Functions

OpenShift Serverless Functions provides a `faas` CLI that enables developers to create and deploy stateless, event-driven functions as a Knative service on OpenShift Container Platform.

The `faas` CLI uses the CNCF Buildpack API to create a container image.
Once a container image has been created, the CLI can deploy it as a Knative service on the cluster configured in ``~/.kube/config`.

Buildpacks and function runtimes are currently available for the Go, Node.js and Quarkus languages.

OpenShift Serverless Functions currently supports the use of HTTP requests or events, as well as standard Kubernetes CloudEvents.
