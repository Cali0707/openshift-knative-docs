= Deleting a function

You can delete a function from your cluster by using the `kn faas delete` command.

.Procedure

* Delete a function:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn faas delete <name> [-n <namespace> -p <path>]
----
** If the name or path of the function to delete is not specified, the current directory is searched for a `faas.yaml` file that can be used to determine the function to delete.
// recommend one function per directory?
** If the namespace is not specified, this defaults to the `namespace` value in the `faas.yaml` file.
