= Testing functions

You can test to see if the function is working by using your browser to visit `http://localhost:8080`. You can also access liveness and readiness endpoints at `http://localhost:8080/health/liveness` and `http://localhost:8080/health/readiness`. These two endpoints are used by Kubernetes to determine the health of your function. If your function is working correctly, both of these endpoints will return `OK`.
