= Quick start

The procedures in this quick start demonstrate how you can create, deploy, and modify functions.

== Prerequisites

Before you can complete the steps in the following procedures, you must ensure that:

* You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which has the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html[OpenShift Serverless Operator], https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-serving.html#installing-knative-serving[Knative Serving] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-eventing.html#installing-knative-eventing[Knative Eventing] installed.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-getting-started[OpenShift `oc` CLI].
* You must have installed https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker], and have access to a DockerHub account.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-kn.html#installing-kn[Knative `kn` CLI]. Installing `kn` provides the binary that enables use of the `kn faas` commands. There is no additional setup required to use `kn faas` commands after `kn` is successfully installed.

=== Creating a function

You can create a function by using the `kn faas init` command.

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn faas init <path> [-l <runtime> -t <trigger>]
----

* This command creates a new Function project at `path`.
* If the path is not specified, the current directory is used.
* If the path does not exist but is specified, it will be created.
* The function name is the name of the leaf directory at path.
* The user can specify the runtime and trigger with flags.
// TODO: more details about runtimes and triggers; what are the defaults? Can defaults be changed?
// TODO: How to use templates?

.Procedure

* Create a function:
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn faas init functions/fn.example.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Project path: /home/user/functions/fn.example.io
Function name: fn.example.io
Runtime: go
Trigger: http
----

=== Deploying a function

=== Delete a function
