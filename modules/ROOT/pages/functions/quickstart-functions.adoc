= Quick start

The procedures in this quick start demonstrate how you can create, deploy, and modify functions.

== Prerequisites

Before you can complete the steps in the following procedures, you must ensure that:

* You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which has the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html[OpenShift Serverless Operator], https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-serving.html#installing-knative-serving[Knative Serving] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-eventing.html#installing-knative-eventing[Knative Eventing] installed.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-getting-started[OpenShift `oc` CLI].
* You must have installed https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker], and have access to a DockerHub account.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-kn.html#installing-kn[Knative `kn` CLI]. Installing `kn` provides the binary that enables use of the `kn faas` commands. There is no additional setup required to use `kn faas` commands after `kn` is successfully installed.

=== Creating a function

You can create a function by using the `kn faas create` command.

.Procedure

. Create a directory for the function and navigate to it:
+
.Example commands
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir functions
$ cd functions
$ mkdir fn.example.io
$ cd fn.example.io
----
. After you have navigated to the functions directory, create a function:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn faas init
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Project path: /home/user/functions/fn.example.io
Function name: fn.example.io
Runtime: go
Trigger: http
----

=== Deploying a function

=== Describing a function

You can see information about a function by describing it in the terminal using the `kn faas describe` command.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the functions directory:
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd fn.example.io
----
. After you have navigated to the functions directory, describe the function:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn faas describe
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Function name:
  fn.example.io
Function is built in image:
  docker.io/abrennan89/fn.example.io:latest
Function is deployed as Knative Service:
  fn-example-io
Function is deployed in namespace:
  default
Routes:
  http://fn-example-io-default.apps.ci-ln-g9f36hb-d5d6b.origin-ci-int-aws.dev.rhcloud.com
----

=== Delete a function
