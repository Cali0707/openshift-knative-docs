* You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which has the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html[OpenShift Serverless Operator], https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-serving.html#installing-knative-serving[Knative Serving] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-eventing.html#installing-knative-eventing[Knative Eventing] installed.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-getting-started[OpenShift `oc` CLI].
* You have installed https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker], and have access to a DockerHub account.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-kn.html#installing-kn[Knative `kn` CLI].
