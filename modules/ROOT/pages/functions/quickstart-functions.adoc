== Prerequisites

Before you can complete the steps in the following procedures, you must ensure that:

* You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which has the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html[OpenShift Serverless Operator], https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-serving.html#installing-knative-serving[Knative Serving] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-eventing.html#installing-knative-eventing[Knative Eventing] installed.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-getting-started[OpenShift `oc` CLI].
* You have installed https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker], and have access to a publicly available image registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using `quay.io` as the image registry, you must ensure that the repository is not private. The first time an image is deployed these settings may need to be updated.
====
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-kn.html#installing-kn[Knative `kn` CLI]. Installing `kn` provides the binary that enables use of the `kn func` commands. There is no additional setup required to use `kn func` commands after `kn` is successfully installed.
