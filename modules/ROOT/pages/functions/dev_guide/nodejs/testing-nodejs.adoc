= Testing a Node.js function locally

Node.js functions can be tested locally on your computer. In the default project that is created when you create a function using `kn func create`, there is a test folder which contains some simple unit and integration tests.

. To run these tests locally, you must install the required dependencies:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ npm install
----

. Once you have installed the dependencies, run the tests:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ npm test
----

[NOTE]
====
The default test framework for Node.js functions is tape. If you prefer to use another framework, you can remove the tape dependency from the `package.json` file and install your preferred testing framework.
