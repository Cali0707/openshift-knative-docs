= Testing a Golang function locally

Golang functions can be tested locally on your computer. In the default project that is created when you create a function using `kn func create`, there is a `handle_test.go` file which contains some basic tests. These tests can be extended as needed.

* Run the test:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ go test
----
