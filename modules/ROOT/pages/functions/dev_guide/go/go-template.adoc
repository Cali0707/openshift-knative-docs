= Golang function template structure

When you create a Golang function using the `kn func` CLI, the project directory looks like a typical Go project, with the exception of an additional `func.yaml` configuration file. Both `http` and `event` trigger functions have the same template structure:

.Template structure
[source,terminal]
----
fn
├── README.md
├── func.yaml <1>
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── handle.go
└── handle_test.go
----
<1> The `func.yaml` configuration file is used to determine the image name and registry.

Golang functions have very few restrictions. The only requirement is that your project must be defined in a `function` module and exports the function `Handle()`.
