= Python function template structure

When you create a Python function using the `kn func` CLI, the project directory looks like a typical Python project, with the exception of an additional `func.yaml` configuration file. Both `http` and `event` trigger functions have the same template structure:

.Template structure
[source,terminal]
----
fn
├── func.py <1>
├── func.yaml <2>
├── requirements.txt <3>
└── test_func.py <4>
----
<1> Python functions have very few restrictions. The only real requirement is that your project contain a `func.py` file which contains a `main()` function.
<2> The `func.yaml` configuration file is used to determine the image name and registry.
<3> Additional dependencies can be added to the `requirements.txt` file as they would be in any other Python project.
<4> The `test_func.py` file contains a simple unit test that can be used to test your function locally.
