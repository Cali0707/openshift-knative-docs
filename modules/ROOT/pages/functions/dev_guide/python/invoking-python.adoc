// = Invoking Python functions

Python functions can be invoked with a simple HTTP request. When an incoming request is received, functions are invoked with a `context` object as the first parameter.

== Context objects

Functions are invoked by providing a `context` object as the first parameter. This object is a Python class with two attributes.

* The `request` attribute will always be present, and contains the Flask `request` object.
* The second attribute, `cloud_event`, will be populated if the incoming request is a `CloudEvent`.

Developers may access any `CloudEvent` data from the context object.

    print(f"Event data {context.cloud_event.data})
