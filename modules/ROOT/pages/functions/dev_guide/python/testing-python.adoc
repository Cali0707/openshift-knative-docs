= Testing a Python function locally

Python functions can be tested locally on your computer. In the default project that is created when you create a function using `kn func create`, there is a `test_func.py` file which contains a simple unit test.

. To run these tests locally, you must install the required dependencies:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

. Once you have installed the dependencies, run the tests:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ python3 test_func.py
----

[NOTE]
====
The default test framework for Python functions is `unittest`. You can use a different test framework if you prefer.
